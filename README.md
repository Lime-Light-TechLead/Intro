Dear Interns,

**Welcome aboard!** My name is Egon, my team and I will be assigning,monitoring and checking your assignments/projects. In this programme we will be focusing on learning via practicing to code. To complete this programme your **3 tasks** have to be accepted. A bonus task holds 1/2 value.

For each task we need you to read/understand the code and to use your creativity to design your **own version**.

In case of Identical submission your task will not be accepted.

Should you have questions do not hesitate to write us. We are open 24/7. **Happy Coding!**
